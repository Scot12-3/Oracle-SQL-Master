# Oracle Database & PL/SQL — Overview, Features, and Quick Start

This repository collects notes, examples, and resources for working with Oracle Database and PL/SQL.
The README below is a concise reference and getting-started guide for developers, DBAs, and learners.

## What is Oracle Database?

Oracle Database is a multi-model, enterprise-grade relational database management system (RDBMS).
It supports SQL for data querying and Data Definition/Manipulation, plus PL/SQL — Oracle's procedural
extension to SQL — for writing stored procedures, triggers, functions, packages and more.

Key capabilities:

- ACID-compliant transactional engine with sophisticated recovery and backup options.
- Advanced concurrency control and row-level locking.
- Rich security model (roles, privileges, Virtual Private Database, auditing).
- High-availability features (RAC, Data Guard, GoldenGate for replication/migration).
- Performance features: cost-based optimizer, partitioning, parallel query, and in-memory options.

## What is PL/SQL?

PL/SQL (Procedural Language/SQL) is Oracle's procedural extension to SQL. It combines SQL data-manipulation
capabilities with procedural constructs (loops, conditionals, exception handling), enabling complex business
logic to run inside the database for performance, maintainability, and security.

Benefits of PL/SQL:

- Tight integration with SQL and the Oracle engine.
- Reduced network traffic (logic runs server-side).
- Reusable modules (procedures, functions, packages).
- Robust error handling via exceptions.
- Support for cursors, records, collections, bulk operations (BULK COLLECT / FORALL).

## Who should read this README

- Developers who will write stored procedures, functions, or complex queries.
- DBAs who need to understand PL/SQL deployment, security, and performance tradeoffs.
- Students preparing for Oracle SQL / PL/SQL exams or practical tasks.

## Quick Start — Tools and Connectors


Common ways to connect to Oracle:

- SQL*Plus / SQLcl (command-line clients bundled by Oracle)
- Oracle SQL Developer (GUI IDE)
- Toad for Oracle (commercial IDE)
- JDBC, ODBC, Python cx_Oracle / oracledb, Node oracledb, .NET providers

Quick example: connect with SQLcl / SQL*Plus

1) From terminal:

   sql / as sysdba    -- (local OS authenticated)
   sql user/password@//host:port/service_name

2) Or using SQL Developer: create a new connection and provide host, port (default 1521), and service name/SID.

## Typical uses of PL/SQL and Oracle Database

- Encapsulating business logic inside stored procedures/functions.
- Writing triggers for auditing, validation, or derived data maintenance.
- Batch processing with PL/SQL anonymous blocks and job schedulers (DBMS_SCHEDULER).
- Complex reporting using PL/SQL to assemble results and pipe data.
- Data transformation and ETL tasks using bulk operations.

## Small PL/SQL Examples (copy/paste into SQL*Plus / SQLcl / SQL Developer)

1) Anonymous block (ad-hoc logic)

   BEGIN
     DBMS_OUTPUT.ENABLE;
     DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hello from PL/SQL');
   END;
   /

2) Simple procedure and call

   CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE greet(p_name IN VARCHAR2) AS
   BEGIN
     DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hello, ' || p_name || '!');
   END greet;
   /

   BEGIN
     greet('Alice');
   END;
   /

3) Function returning a value

   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_employee_count(p_deptno IN NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER AS
     v_count NUMBER;
   BEGIN
     SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_count FROM emp WHERE deptno = p_deptno;
     RETURN v_count;
   EXCEPTION
     WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN
       RETURN 0;
   END get_employee_count;
   /

   -- Usage
   DECLARE
     n NUMBER;
   BEGIN
     n := get_employee_count(10);
     DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employees in dept 10: ' || n);
   END;
   /

4) Simple row-level trigger (audit)

   CREATE TABLE emp_audit (
     empno NUMBER,
     action VARCHAR2(10),
     action_date DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE
   );

   CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_emp_audit
   AFTER INSERT OR DELETE OR UPDATE ON emp
   FOR EACH ROW
   BEGIN
     IF INSERTING THEN
       INSERT INTO emp_audit(empno, action) VALUES(:NEW.empno, 'INSERT');
     ELSIF UPDATING THEN
       INSERT INTO emp_audit(empno, action) VALUES(:NEW.empno, 'UPDATE');
     ELSIF DELETING THEN
       INSERT INTO emp_audit(empno, action) VALUES(:OLD.empno, 'DELETE');
     END IF;
   END;
   /

5) Cursor and loop

   DECLARE
     CURSOR c_emp IS SELECT empno, ename FROM emp WHERE deptno = 10;
     r_emp c_emp%ROWTYPE;
   BEGIN
     OPEN c_emp;
     LOOP
       FETCH c_emp INTO r_emp;
       EXIT WHEN c_emp%NOTFOUND;
       DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(r_emp.empno || ' - ' || r_emp.ename);
     END LOOP;
     CLOSE c_emp;
   END;
   /

6) Bulk collect / FORALL (high-performance bulk DML)

   DECLARE
     TYPE t_empno IS TABLE OF emp.empno%TYPE;
     l_empnos t_empno;
   BEGIN
     SELECT empno BULK COLLECT INTO l_empnos FROM emp WHERE deptno = 10;

     FORALL i IN 1 .. l_empnos.COUNT
       UPDATE emp SET sal = sal * 1.05 WHERE empno = l_empnos(i);

     COMMIT;
   END;
   /

Notes: use DBMS_OUTPUT.SET_LINE_LIMIT and DBMS_OUTPUT.GET_LINE for large output handling. In SQL Developer, enable DBMS_OUTPUT view.

## PL/SQL Language Features (high-level)

- Blocks: DECLARE / BEGIN / EXCEPTION / END
- Procedures & Functions
- Packages (group related procedures, types, constants)
- Triggers (row-level and statement-level)
- Cursors (explicit and implicit), REF CURSOR
- Collections: associative arrays, nested tables, VARRAYs
- Records and %ROWTYPE, %TYPE for strong typing
- Exception handling: predefined and user-defined exceptions
- Bulk operations: BULK COLLECT, FORALL
- Utilities: DBMS_OUTPUT, DBMS_SQL, DBMS_LOB, UTL_FILE, DBMS_SCHEDULER

## Best Practices

- Prefer named binds and bind variables in client code (avoid hard-parsed SQL statements).
- Use bulk operations (BULK COLLECT / FORALL) for large row counts to minimize context switches.
- Keep transactions short — acquire and release locks quickly.
- Use packages to encapsulate and version APIs.
- Avoid excessive use of triggers for business logic; prefer explicit procedure calls when possible.
- Write meaningful exception handling (log and re-raise when appropriate).
- Leverage Oracle's optimizer hints sparingly — prefer proper indexing and statistics.

## Performance Tips

- Collect optimizer statistics regularly (DBMS_STATS).
- Use partitioning for very large tables.
- Design indexes to support common predicates and join keys.
- Monitor wait events (AWR/ASH, Enterprise Manager) to find bottlenecks.
- Consider using PL/SQL function result cache or materialized views for expensive calculations.

## Security and Deployment

- Use least-privilege principle for database users and roles.
- Avoid creating database links with highly privileged accounts.
- Secure PL/SQL code by signing packages or using invoker/definer rights appropriately.
- Use Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for sensitive data at rest.

## Testing & Versioning

- Store PL/SQL source in version control (Git). Keep create/replace scripts idempotent where possible.
- Use unit testing frameworks (utPLSQL is popular in the Oracle ecosystem).
- Automate deployments with CI/CD pipelines (run static checks, run tests, deploy to staging then prod).

## Troubleshooting & Debugging

- Use DBMS_OUTPUT for simple debugging (but don't rely on it in production).
- For step-debugging, use IDE support (SQL Developer has a PL/SQL debugger).
- Inspect errors with SQLERRM and SQLCODE in exception handlers.
